## poli122: Poliastro to Poliastro2 Migration Tool
[poli122](https://github.com/nra-research/poliastro2/blob/main/src/poliastro2/dev_tools/poli122.py) is a Python script designed to simplify the process of migrating your project dependency from poliastro to poliastro2. It provides functions to automatically convert module and import paths, adapting your existing code to the new structure and organization of poliastro2.

```python
# NOTE: run conversion script ONCE; fix additional errors when needed
import os
from poliastro2.dev_tools.poli122 import convert_122
tests_dir = os.getcwd()
convert_122(tests_dir, old_parent="poliastro", new_parent="poliastro2")
```
The complete general path mapping can be viewed at: [122mapping.json](https://github.com/nra-research/poliastro2/blob/main/src/poliastro2/dev_tools/122mapping.json)

## Context
üïπÔ∏è
**What is poliastro2?**

**poliastro2** is a fork of poliastro, THE astrodynamics Python library. poliastro2 builds upon the foundational capabilities of Poliastro, enhancing its modularity and extending its potential as a comprehensive astrodynamics toolbox.

ü§î
**Why poliastro2?**

**poliastro2**‚Äôs primary goal is to continue the development and expansion of a purely Python-based astrodynamics simulation framework. poliastro2 has a complete new sructure that prioritizes modularity, portability, and an expanded range of simulation capabilities. This includes better representation of objects in the simulation üåçenvironment, such as üì°ground stations, üõ∞Ô∏èspacecraft, and other üöómoving or üè†stationary targets.

The **poliastro2/core** is structured to facilitate continuous development. Future features will include üó∫Ô∏èsimulation senario, üß≤electromagnetic environment, üìªcommunication systems, and a variety of objects.

All general low-level functions related to calculations and data manipulation have been separated from the core structure. This separation allows for easy reuse, replacement, or extension by üîåexternal modules, enabling enhanced performance and customizable algorithms.

**What's poliastro?**

 [poliastro](https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro) is an open source (MIT) pure Python library for interactive Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics. It was authored by Juan Luis Cano Rodr√≠guez and maintained by the poliastro development team.

The poliastro project was archived on Oct 14, 2023 by the project owner:

> _poliastro is archived and will not be developed any further, see https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/1640 for more context._
> _Forks welcome, please respect the license by retaining attribution, and consider rebranding your fork if you intend to develop it in the long run._
