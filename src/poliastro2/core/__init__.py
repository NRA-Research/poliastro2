Description
-----------
This subpackage contains specialized core routines for orbital mechanics and astrodynamics.
It provides modules for ephemerides, event detection, and a variety of actions related
to orbit propagation, maneuvers, and coordinate transformations.

Modules
-------
- ephem: Ephemeris computations.
- events: Event detection routines.
- actions: Subpackage containing maneuvers, propagation, and thrust routines.
- frames: Definitions and transformations for coordinate frames.
- math: Mathematical utilities supporting core routines.
- orbit: Functions for orbit creation and scalar computations.
- spacecraft: Spacecraft modeling routines.
- threebody: Tools for solving the three-body problem.
- twobody: Routines for two-body orbital mechanics.
